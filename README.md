# PythonMorsels

My solutions to Python Morsels.

Each folder is a Morsel with problem statement, my solution, and automated tests.

Generally the comment blocks are solutions to the base problem and subsequent bonuses in order - 
unless the solution is class-based, in which case it generally adds on to previous code.
